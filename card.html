			<p class="description">Sea Otters are the coolest animals on the planet. They lay around on their backs
				in the water all day, which is what 99% of humans wish they could be doing right now!
				They also have great personalities and seem kind for a creature that gets eaten
				by Great White Sharks. A Sea Otter is my spirit animal.
